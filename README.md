## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  - absolute positioning works in respect to previous positioned parent
  - clip-path to clip images
  - using input:checked to add interactivity
### Continued development

Played a lot with relative and absolute positioning. Also, learned how to clip images and played with different selectors. Would love to explore these further in the future.
